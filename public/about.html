<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a current M.S. candidate at Kennesaw State University, seeking my degree in Software Engineering. 
  For my undergraduate studies, I attended the University of Georgia, where I received a BBA in Business.
  I have long been interested in computers and their functionality, so Software Engineering feels
  like a natural fit.</p>

<p>Through my studies, I hope to gain the skills necessary to pursue a career as a developer. I am particularly
  interested in Software Engineering as a career because it allows me to be a problem solver to real life
  issues and to take little more than thoughts and turn them into reality. I grew up in the technology generation, 
  and it is my goal to play my part in shaping the future.</p>
